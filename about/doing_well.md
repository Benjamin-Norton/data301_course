How to do well in this course
=======================

This course is very interesting and very useful. However, there is a lot to cover in a short timeframe. It is not necessarily complicated, but it requires practice.

### To do well in this course you should:

- Do your work **on time**
  - Listen to the videos when they arrive
  - Take notes of the videos to support your learning
  - Complete your quizzes on time
  - Start your lab early and finish it on time
  - Start your project early

- Participate:
  - Check Ed discussion: ask questions if yours have not been asked yet
  - Participate in class activities, the more you are an active participant, the better for your learning
  - Contact me or the TA if you are struggling. The earliest you realize that there are some concepts you don't get, the faster we can make sure you are back on track!

- Complete all lab assignments:
  - Labs are for marks and are practice to learn the material for the exams

### To get an “A” in this course do all the above plus:
- Practice on your own. Practice makes perfect.
- Do more questions than in the labs.  Try the techniques on your own data sets.
