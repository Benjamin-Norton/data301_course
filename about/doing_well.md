How to do well in this course
=======================

This course is very interesting and very useful. However, there is a lot to cover in a short timeframe. It is not necessarily complicated, but it requires practice.

To do well in this course you should:

- Do your work **on time**
  - Listen to the videos when they arrive
  - Start your lab early and finish it on time
- Participate:
  - Check Ed discussion: ask questions if yours have not been asked yet
  - Participate in class activities
  - Contact me or the TA if you are struggling. The earliest you realize that there are some concepts you don't get, the faster we can make sure you are back on track!
