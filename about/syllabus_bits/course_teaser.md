This course is one of my favourite courses to teach at UBCO!
It was initially created by Dr. Ramon Lawrence, and has since been updated by various folks including Dr. Patricia Lasserre, Dr. Firas Moosvi, Dr. Irene Vrbik, Dr. Scott Fazackerley, and others.
It is a fantastic introduction to the field of Data Science and in this one course, you will be equipped to handle most of the common Data wrangling, processing, and analysis tasks.
You will also be introduced to a variety of tools (tech stack) that are common in the industry, and we hope you use this course as a spring board to launch your interest in Data Science!
