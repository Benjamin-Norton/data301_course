In this section, I will outline any changes that have been made to the unsyllabus as we go through the course.
We will do our best to follow the plan outlined in this unsyllabus, but in case things go south, I will need to make adjustments to the contents and the schedule.

Any major changes to the syllabus (this page) will be documented here, as well as the date the change was made.

| Sept 10, 2021 | Fixed typo that cause confusion about whether there are 4 tests or 3. There are 4 tests | We need 4 tests to adequately cover testing of essential course content.                                |
| Nov 3, 2021   | Moved up Test 4 by a week, updated material for Week 11 and 12                          | Adjusted schedule to talk about Excel earlier and freed up the last week for you to wrap-up the project |
| Nov. 19, 2021 | Moved Test 4 and Bonus Test 4 down a week again (back to original plan)                 | Climate Change and just general chaos                                                                   |
