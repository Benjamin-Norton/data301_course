# DATA and COSC 301

The course website is here: [firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301)

Everytime you push to master, that system will redeploy the site to my server.
It may take about 90s to build, and another few seconds to become live.

## Phase 1: Migrate content from PPT files to Markdown and jupyter notebooks

- We will use Markdown files for content that should just be "read"
- Jupyter notebooks for things that need code.

## Phase 2: Re-organize content 

## Phase 3: Add videos

## Phase 4: Add new content (Firas)
