## Open Data
### What is open data?
􏰏 - Open Data is the movement to make data freely available to all with no restrictions on use or copyright.
 - Governments have been major supporters and providers of open data as data collected by governments is primarily done to benefit its citizens.
 - Corporations and other organizations are both producers and consumers of open data.
 ### Open data in Canada
􏰏 - Federal, provincial, and local governments have all been involved in the open data movement.

Example: DriveBC
􏰏 􏰏
- DriveBC is the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure’s traveller information system.

### Open Data Worldwide
􏰏 􏰏
􏰏- UK: http://data.gov.uk

􏰏      - Financial information and statistics 
- United Nations: http://data.un.org/
- OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development): https://data.oecd.org/

### Open Data Aggregation
􏰏 - There are many sites that aggregate open data sets (and some data sets for a cost). A Canadian based site is [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com).
􏰏 - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) provides many data sets and competitions and techniques for data analytics and machine learning.
􏰏 - More recently, Google has released a search engine called [Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com) for finding data sets.
􏰏        - provides easier access to millions of datasets across thousands of data repositories on the web.

### Open Data from Companies
- Many companies either have public data or application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow people to use their data.
􏰏 􏰏 􏰏 􏰏 􏰏
- Google: public data explorer and Google Maps API 
- Facebook: https://developers.facebook.com/ (API) 
- reddit: https://www.reddit.com/dev/api (API)

### Your turn
􏰏
- Explore the federal, provincial, and City of Kelowna data sets to discover “something interesting".
- From any Canadian government open data site, retrieve a data set and analyze and visualize it using one of our tools: Excel, R, Python, Tableau.

### Open Data for Researcher
􏰏
- Increasingly publicly funded researchers are responsible for making their data sets, procedures, and results available to the public (and other researchers).
􏰏      - Canadian researchers funded by [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/NSERC-CRSNG/policies-politiques/OpenAccessFAQ-LibreAccesFAQ_eng.asp), SSHRC, CIHR must make their publications freely available within 12 months of publication.
􏰏      - Researchers in bioinformatics and other fields must make their data sets publically available in a database or repository.
- Researchers benefit by having access to public data sets and data sets of other researchers, but there is also a challenge as producing data sets (and perhaps commercializing results) may restrict open access.
### Open Data Biology/Bioinformatics
Huge number of databases with most related to [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) but distributed world-wide.
