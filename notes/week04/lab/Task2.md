# Lab 3: Practicing Git

## Task 2: GitHub Tutorial - Remote

Continuing with the [same tutorial](http://learngitbranching.js.org), complete the following modules:

- "Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4
  - Exercise 5
  - Exercise 6
  - Exercise 7
  - Exercise 8

- "To Origin And Beyond -- Advanced Git Remotes!"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4
  - Exercise 5
  - Exercise 6
  - Exercise 7
  - Exercise 8

Once you are done, you should include at most two screenshots - one from the "Main" tab (Task 1) and one from the "Remotes" (Task 2) tab, though ideally if you can submit one screenshot that'll be easier for the TAs to grade.

Here is an example of the screenshot we are expecting.
