    "\n",
    "- There will be a 48 hour window during which you can start the exam at any time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The final exam window will OPEN Sunday, Aug 15 at 18:00 (on Gradescope).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The final exam window will CLOSE Tuesday, Aug 17 at 18:00. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Format:** you will get to work with a dataset you haven't seen before and be asked to do a comprehensive data analysis, some of it guided, and some of it unguided.\n",
    "    - You will need to do all the steps of a Data Analysis.\n",
    "    - You will be given some research questions to answer, based on the data.\n",
    "    - You will also need to do come up with your own research questions and answer them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The exam will not be proctored or invigilated, but the same rules as the Test apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember that you will need to accept a GH Classroom link (just like with the labs) and then submit your repository link once you are finished with the exam. "

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will find the link to accept the GH Classroom link on Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will also need to commit to the repo and push to GitHub at various points during the exam (I will have instructions in the exam for when you should be committing, and pushing). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The exam is designed to be completed in 2 - 2.5 hours, but you will have the full 48 hour window to spend on the exam. I highly recommend that you block out a chunk of time and finish the exam in one sitting. You have other exams to deal with as well, and just because I give you 48 hours, does not mean you have to use all of it!! \n",
    "\n",
    "- You will need to make sure your JupyterLab installation is functioning, Git and Python is working, and all the packages used in the course are installed. This will be a required aspect of the final exam!\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will need to frequently commit your work using the Terminal (i.e. NOT GitHub desktop, or the web uploader!) so please make sure you know how to do that. It will be just like the labs and milestones, if you've been keeping up, I don't expect you'll have a problem.\n",

    "- You must complete the test BY YOURSELF (no friends, no tutors, no classmates, no humans - cats and dogs in the room are fine).\n",
    "- You will not be able to ask us questions during the quiz - do your best with your best interpretation of the question.\n",
    "- The test is open-book, open-notes, open-web EXCEPT you CANNOT use websites that help you cheat such as Chegg, Course Hero, Slader and other similar websites that have tutors answering questions you upload (Stack Overflow is allowed).\n",
    "- Using google to search for concepts is NOT cheating. For example, you can search for definitions of terms, and commands.\n",
    "- If you accidentally come across the same or similar test question on google, resist the temptation to keep reading, and just close your browser tab.\n",
    "- You can also use any code editor, or JupyterLab, etc to run and test your code.\n",
    "- Any form of communication with other humans, terrestrial or extraterrestrial is not allowed (Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Terminal, Signal, iMessage, SMS, MMS, etc…) and IS CHEATING\n",
    "- Do NOT share test questions with your anyone - that IS CHEATING.\n",
    "- Do not be anxious about the test! If you don’t do well - review the material and try again next week - we will take the better of the two scores!\n",
