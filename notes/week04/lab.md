# Lab 2 - Command Line Practice

This week, there are two tasks for you to do: continuing your machine set-up, and practicing the command-line through a game. 

## Part 1: Setting up Python and Jupyter Lab (30%)

Below are the instructions for you to continue installing software on your system. We will need this for the first python lecture this week.

- [macOS Part 2](install_ds_stack_mac_part2.md)
- [Windows Part 2](install_ds_stack_windows_part2.md)

At the end, please include a screenshot of a working Jupyter Lab session locally on your computer with a python kernel to get full marks for this portion.

## Part 2: Practicing with Command Line (70%)

This will be updated soon with a video from me guiding you through a game called `Dashcrawl`.
Stay tuned...
