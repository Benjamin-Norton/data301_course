# Preparation for Lab 7

## [IMPORTANT] Fill in the Survey 
In this lab you will prepare and publish the dashboard for your project. Your first step before working on the dashboard is to fill in this [survey](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_etwwurNao6VTE9w).

The [survey](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_etwwurNao6VTE9w) will be use for two purposes:
1. To give you access to examples of dashboard from last term projects.
2. To give you access to Tableau online. Tableau online will be used to publish the dashboard you will have produced on Tableau desktop. 

```{warning}
Once you have finished the survey, I will then have to invite you to the site (this will take **at least a day**). After you are invited, you will get an email that looks like this:

Once you have joined, you can then view the examples and follow the steps to publish your workbook.
```

##  Examples of dashboards from previous years
Once you have been invited to Tableau online and have logged in once, you will have access to some  examples of dashboards from last term. I encourage you to look at them before starting the lab. It might help you create your own dashboard for your own data.

Examples:
* [Cancer Cases and Types in Canada (Except QC)](https://us-west-2b.online.tableau.com/#/site/data301/views/CancerCasesandTypesinCanadaexceptQC-/TotalCancerCases?:iid=4)
