# Videos

Below is just one short assigned video for this week. 
It is a workshop/tutorial that I made a few months ago (June 2020) with a former colleague, Hayley Boyce.
I have linked [Lab 7](./lab7) to this tutorial almost exactly, so I suggest you try to follow along Lab 7 while you watch this and you'll kill two birds with one stone during this short week.

The videos are collapsible so once you're done with one, you can move to the next one.
In the sidebar on the right, you can use the checklists to keep track of what's done.

## Optional Videos

In case you want an 'alternate' video on the basics of Tableau, here is one I recommend based on the `titanic` dataset.
