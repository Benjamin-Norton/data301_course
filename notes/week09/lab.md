# Lab Note

Due to a scheduling mixup (my fault), I need to combine Labs 5 and 6 together.
Do not worry, it is not "twice" the amount of work - the lab is almost the same length (maybe a little longer) but it is about two disparate topics: advanced git and data visualizations.

## Lab 5

After many years of searching, I have found the [**PERFECT** tutorial](http://learngitbranching.js.org) to help you get more familiar with git commands, particularly branching, and merging - things you will start encountering when you start collaboratively working on the projects.
Rather than make this a milestone task though, I will be including it as part of Lab 5.
It's included here so you know that you should do this part of the lab before proceeding to Task 3 onwards.
You are responsible for completing the following modules (at minimium):

- "Main: Introduction Sequence" <- This should mostly be review
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4

- "Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes" <- This is new stuff and you should spend time working through the tutorial.
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4
  - Exercise 5
  - Exercise 6
  - Exercise 7
  - Exercise 8
