Week 3 Summary
=======================
## List of things to do this week
<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task1" class="box"> **Attend Live lecture** </input></label>

```{tip}
This week we are slowing down so that you have the time to play with Excel functionalities. As so, the lecture will only be there to answer students questions on topics already covered (more like a live office hour). 
```

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task2" class="box"> [**Watch the course videos**](./videos.md) </input></label>

```{tip}
In the video, I'll introduce more advanced material regarding Excel functionalities that I do not expect you to use in this class. However, it is important to know that it exists.
```
<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task3" class="box"> [**Attend Lab2**](./lab1.md) </input></label>

```{tip}
This lab is very short so that you can use the remaining time to complete [Lab1](./week02/lab1.md) which might be longer for you to complete. 

Use also the time with the TA to make sure that you are ready with Jupyter Lab as next week, we will start learning Python.
```
<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task4" class="box"> [**Complete and submit Lab0**](../week1/lab.md) </input></label>

```{tip}
If not already done, make sure to submit Lab0. Deadline is Friday (with 48 hrs).
```
<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task5" class="box"> **Do Test1**</input></label>

```{tip}
The test will be done in Canvas. Link to come...
