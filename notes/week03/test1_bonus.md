# Bonus Test 1

You will find Bonus Test 1 on Canvas.

Content you should review for Bonus Test 1 includes:

- Commandline and Terminal
    - Commands we discussed in Lecture 1B, more advanced commands from the BashCrawl game from lab will not be assessed
- Basics of git
    - "It is important to realize that in this course, you will not explicitly be tested on any git commands except `add`, `commit`,`fetch`,`push`,`pull`,`branch`."
- Basics of python programming
    - Here are some **sample** topics that may be tested (this is not the exhaustive list):
        - Python syntax
        - Valid names of variables
        - Lists and Dictionaries
        - Loops
        - Conditionals

```{important}
Remember that for every Test, there is also a Bonus Test and we will take the better of the two scores so there is no harm in doing both Tests. A Test and a Bonus Test will be on essentially the same material.

```{warning}
You will likely not get your Test results back before the Bonus Test, so please plan accordingly. Once the Test is over, you will however be able to see the questions you got.
