# Class 3C: Branches and Pull Requests with Git

Before this class, please make sure you [watch the assigned Git videos on this page](../videos.md).

During class we will do the following:

## Create and resolve a merge conflict

1. Message your groupmates and get in touch with them

2. ONE PERSON IN EACH ROOM, will fork this repository onto your own GitHub account

3. Clone that fork onto your computer

4. Add your teammates to the repository

5. Teammates clone onto computer

6. Try to create and resolve a merge conflict.

### Tips
Here are some command sequences that might be useful:

```
- git switch -c 'person1'
- git switch -c 'person2'
- edit the file
- add, commit, push
- deal with the Pull Request(PR) on GitHub
```
