Week 13 Summary
=======================

We are reaching the end of term. I'll put both this week and the next two days of the last week in the same summary.

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week13_task1" class="box"> [**Listen and Practice with the video**](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/64282/pages/week-12-querying-a-database-example?module_item_id=3059764)</input></label>

```{tip}
There is no lecture this week (Easter Monday), instead, there will be a recording of the remainder of the example (under preparation). 

The last lecture will be to answer questions on databases before the test.
```

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week13_task2" class="box"> [**Practice with Lab8**](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/64282/assignments/791131)</input></label>

```{tip}
This lab is optional. It is for you to practice SQL prior to Test 5. There are some nice [tools](./Lecture13.md) to play with SQL. Solutions will be included with the lab for your perusal.
```


<label><input type="checkbox" id="week13_task3" class="box"> [**Complete Test 5**](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/64282/quizzes/320563)</input></label>

```{tip}
Test 5 will include 2 attempts (to account for Test 5 and Bonus Test 5).
It will be principally about databases and SQL (there might be a few questions on efficient dashboards as well). 
```

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week13_task4" class="box"> [**Submit Lab7**](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/64282/assignments/791130)</input></label>

```{tip}
If not already done so, do not forget to submit your dashboard in the project repository as well as the link to tableau online.

Note that we currently have issues with Tableau online. I'm working on a solution.

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week13_task5" class="box"> [**Complete Milestone4**](../../project/milestone04.md) </input></label>

```{tip}
Don't forget to submit your video link !
