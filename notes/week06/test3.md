# Test 3

You will find Test 3 on Canvas.

Content you should review for Test 3 includes:

- Principles of Effective Visualization
- Data visualization with `seaborn`
- Excel (spreadsheet functions)

```{important}
Remember that for every Test, there is also a Bonus Test and we will take the better of the two scores so there is no harm in doing both Tests. A Test and a Bonus Test will be on essentially the same material.
```

```{warning}
You will likely not get your Test results back before the Bonus Test, so please plan accordingly. Once the Test is over, you will however be able to see the questions you got.
