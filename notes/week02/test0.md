# Test 0

Note: Test 0 is NOT for marks, it's just for practice to get familiar with class tests mechanics.
You do not need to study for it, it will ask questions like "who is your instructor", "what time is the lecture time for this class etc..."

We will do Test 0 in class, all together to simulate the experience.
