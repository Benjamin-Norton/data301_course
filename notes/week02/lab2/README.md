# DATA 301 Lab 2

In Lab 2 of this course, we will be diving straight into the thick of things and you'll be getting a taste of working with Git, and then Python.

The first part of this lab is about working through the learngitbranching tool.
In the second part, you will do some Python exercises with JupyterLab.

In the final part, you will record a 5-minute screencast of your lab.
This is what will be marked by the TAs and it is important that you be able to explain all of your solutions as a video.

## Instructions for Lab 2A

For this lab, you will need to open [`lab2B.md`](lab2B/README.md) and follow the instructions within.

## Instructions for Lab 2B

For this lab, you will need to open [`lab2B.ipynb`](lab2B/lab2B.ipynb) and follow the instructions within.

I have recorded a video to get you started with this lab: [Click here to view the video](https://vimeo.com/570824958).

## Lab 2 Explainer Video

Starting this week, for each of the labs you submit, you will need to an "Explainer Video" showing highlights of your assignments.

Note that you only need to create ONE video per lab (so Lab 2A and 2B should be shown in ONE video).

[Here is a video](https://vimeo.com/572844343) explaining this process in all the details:
