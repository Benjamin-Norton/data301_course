# Lecture 2 - Introduction to Microsoft Excel

## Excel file used in lecture.

You can download the [Excel file used in lecture](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/64282/files/12336918?module_item_id=2841388) to do the activities while following along.

## Lecture slides
The [slides](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/64282/pages/week2-introduction-to-excel?module_item_id=2840058) for the Introduction to Excel Lecture can be found with the pre-recorded videos in Canvas.

Note that the slides include what is in the pre-recorded video, as well as likely more than what I'll be able to do on Monday. What I cannot do during the lecture time will be recorded afterwards.

## Command Line
```{tip}
We strongly recommand you use the GitBash instead of the default Windows Command Prompt as it is the Windows version of Linux bash (at least the most common ones such as ls, cat, grep).
```

If you would like some additional notes and a much deeper explanation of the command line, we suggest the notes from [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)! 

In particular, we suggest “Introducing the shell”, “Navigating Files and Directories”, and “Working with Files and Directories”
