## Excel file used in lecture.

You can download the [Excel file used in lecture](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/64282/files/12336918?module_item_id=2841388) to do the activities while following along.

## Lecture slides
The [slides](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/64282/pages/week2-introduction-to-excel?module_item_id=2840058) for the Introduction to Excel Lecture can be found with the pre-recorded videos in Canvas.

Note that the slides include what is in the pre-recorded video, as well as likely more than what I'll be able to do on Monday. What I cannot do during the lecture time will be recorded afterwards.
