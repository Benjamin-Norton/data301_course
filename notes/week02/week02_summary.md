Week 2 Summary
=======================

## List of things to do this week

Below is a list of things you need to do this week, links to where you can do them, as well as roughly the order you should do it.
Note that these are just SUGGESTIONS and you are by no means required to them this way. 
I have put the labs at the end, but if your lab section is earlier in the week, you may want to shift things around.

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task1" class="box"> [**Watch the pre-lecture videos**](./videos.md) </input></label>

```{tip}
To ensure you have all the material in preparation for next week's lab on Excel, I would like you to listen to the 20 minutes video that explain how to enter data in Excel. This will allow you during the lecture to follow along with me as I show more complex actions that can be performed in Excel.

If you already know Excel, you can just glance over it. There might be a couple of tips that you might not know.
```

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task2" class="box"> **Attend the Lecture** </input></label>

```{tip}
Ideally you will come to the lecture this week with your Excel open. You can download the file used in class to follow along in the file [sales.xlsx]([https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/64282/files/12336918?module_item_id=2841388]). We will explore the functions you will need for the lab this week.
```

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task3" class="box"> [**Complete the lab**](./lab1.md) </input></label>

```{tip}
The lab this week will make you explore some standard functions done when doing data analysis using Excel .
```

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task4" class="box"> [**Watch the post-lecture videos**](./videos.md) </input></label>

```{tip}
After the lecture this week, I will post some additional videos for more advanced features of Excel.
```

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task3" class="box"> [**Write the Practice Test (60 mins)**](./test.md) </input></label>

```{tip}
This week's test is NOT for marks. It is only here so you can see how the testing system works (Canvas Quizzes) and make you more comfortbale with the testing system. 

The content of the course is on the course policies, and some other silly questions (again, not for marks).
