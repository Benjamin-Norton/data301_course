## Introduction to Markdown

### What is Markdown?

Markdown allows you to write documents in plain text, that are then “rendered” (or displayed) with some very rudimentary formatting.

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.” 

– John Gruber, [original author of Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

### Why use Markdown?

- Fast!
- Low-barrier to start!
- Operating system independent!
- The text is readable, even as plain text!
- Industry standard - everyone uses Markdown!
- No need for proprietary file formats!
- It's free!

### CommonMark Tutorial (Activity)

There's a wonderful Markdown tutorial that was shown to me recently, so let's go through it together: 

- [CommonMark Tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)

### Key Limitations of Markdown

- Static not Dynamic! There are some extensions that make Markdown more extendable, but that’s outside the scope of this course.

- Cannot resize images!

- Cannot have fine—grained control over many things (bullet type, spacing, tables, etc..)

### Pro Tips to using Markdown

```{important}
We will be using Markdown a LOT in this course!
It is worth your time to go through the [tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) and learn it all at the beginning.
```

- You should also make liberal use of the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

- Finally, remember to use the Visual Studio Code Markdown Preview to see how your Markdown renders!

## Reminder: Learning Log 1

Learning Log 1 will be available to you after the last class of the week is over.

```{important}
That's it, see you next week! Remember to continue working on the "Setup" of your machines and visit the labs next week to get extra help!
