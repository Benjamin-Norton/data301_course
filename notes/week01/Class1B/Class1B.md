## Logistics

During class we will go through some logistics, and then learn about Markdown to help you get setup for Lab 1 (all the programs and software we will be installing).

## Introduction to Markdown

### What is Markdown?

Markdown allows you to write documents in plain text, that are then “rendered” (or displayed) with some very rudimentary formatting.

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.” 

– John Gruber, [original author of Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

### Why use Markdown?

- Fast!
- Low-barrier to start!
- Operating system independent!
- The text is readable, even as plain text!
- Industry standard - everyone uses Markdown!
- No need for proprietary file formats!
- It's free!

### CommonMark Tutorial (Activity)

There's a wonderful Markdown tutorial that was shown to me recently, so let's go through it together: 

- [CommonMark Tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)

### Key Limitations of Markdown

- Static not Dynamic! There are some extensions that make Markdown more extendable, but that’s outside the scope of this course.

- Cannot resize images!

- Cannot have fine—grained control over many things (bullet type, spacing, tables, etc..)

### Pro Tips to using Markdown

```{important}
We will be using Markdown a LOT in this course!
It is worth your time to go through the [tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) and learn it all at the beginning.
```

- You should also make liberal use of the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

- Finally, remember to use the Visual Studio Code Markdown Preview to see how your Markdown renders!

## Tour of Visual Studio Code

VS Code (or Visual Studio Code) is the IDE, or "Interactive Development Environment" we will be using in this course.
Though it is not required for you to use it (you can accomplish the same things in other IDEs like PyCharm, Atom, etc...), I suggest giving it a shot and see how you like it!
In this live demo, I'll show you around the editor and how you can use it for your work:

- Opening a Folder vs. opening an individual file
- Opening a Terminal in VS Code
    - On Windows, you may need to do an extra step to link your GitBash terminal to VS Code
- Sidebar for files
- Search
- Extensions
- Customizing colours, editor layout, other settings

## Reminder: Learning Log 1

Learning Log 1 will be available to you after the last class of the week is over.

```{important}
That's it, see you next week! Remember to continue working on the "Setup" of your machines and visit the labs next week to get extra help!
