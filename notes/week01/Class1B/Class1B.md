During class we will go through some logistics, and then learn about Markdown to help you get setup for Lab 1 (all the programs and software we will be installing).

### CommonMark Tutorial (Activity)

There's a wonderful Markdown tutorial that was shown to me recently, so let's go through it together: 

- [CommonMark Tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)


### More about Markdown

- Key Limitations of Markdown
- Visual Studio Code Markdown Preview (Demo)
- [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

## Tour of Visual Studio Code

VS Code (or Visual Studio Code) is the IDE, or "Interactive Development Environment" we will be using in this course.
Though it is not required for you to use it (you can accomplish the same things in other IDEs like PyCharm, Atom, etc...), I suggest giving it a shot and see how you like it!
In this live demo, I'll show you around the editor and how you can use it for your work:

- Opening a Folder vs. opening an individual file
- Opening a Terminal in VS Code
    - On Windows, you may need to do an extra step to link your GitBash terminal to VS Code
- Sidebar for files
- Search
- Extensions
- Customizing colours, editor layout, other settings

## Reminder: Learning Log 1

Learning Log 1 will be available to you after the last class of the week is over.

That's it, see you next week! Remember to continue working on the "Setup" of your machines and visit the labs next week to get extra help!
