# Class 1B: Data Science Tech Stack

## Logistics

At the start of class, 

During class we will go through some logistics, and then go through the Data Science Tech Stack to explain all the programs and software we will be installing.

### Introduction to Gradescope

In a course like this, it is essential for us to have a smooth process to deliver feedback to you as quickly and efficiently as possible.

#### Why are we using Gradescope?

- Tried to do this just on Canvas in the past, it has HUGE efficiency issues for grading (doesn't allow simultaneous grading, slow, painful, etc...).
- Gradescope has GitHub integration and support for displaying Jupyter Notebooks natively, Canvas does not.
- Gradescope is better at allowing us to provide higher quality feedback more efficiently to students.
- There are a couple of issues with Gradescope, specifically with students "seeing" the feedback we give.
- Students don't seem to mind it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

#### How to see your feedback

I've created a gif for you to see how you can see your feedback.
