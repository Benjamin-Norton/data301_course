## Course Outline

### The Essence of the Course

The overall goal of this course is for you to: 
> Understand data analytics and be able to apply data analysis to data sets using a variety of software tools and techniques.

* The most exciting aspect of data analytics is discovering and presenting useful data/information that can have an impact on business, society, etc.
* This course will provide the tools and skills for you to perform your own data analysis when encountering problems in the real-world.
* As an introductory course, the goal is to get exposure to the skills and techniques as there will not be time for mastery.

### Official Calendar Description
**Official Calendar**: Techniques for computation, analysis, and visualization of data using software. Manipulation of small and large data sets. 
Automation using scripting. Real-world applications from life sciences, physical sciences, economics, engineering, or psychology. 
No prior computing background is required. Credit will be granted for only one of COSC 301, DATA 301 or DATA 501.[3-2-0]

**Prerequisite**: Either (a) third-year standing, or (b) one of COSC 111 (Computer Programming I) or COSC 122 (Computer Fluency). 
Please familiarize yourself with the details outlined on the course syllabus (posted on Canvas).


### Specific Description
**Specific description**: This course provides an introduction to data analytics to train students with practical industrial techniques 
for data manipulation, analysis, reporting, and visualization.
This is **not** an introduction to programming.

* Programming techniques will be taught to automate data analysis.
* Introduction to programming courses are COSC 111 or COSC 123.
* Prior computing experience is not required, but is helpful (for instance COSC 122 or COSC 111).


### Course Objectives
1. Understand data representation formats and techniques and how to use them.
1. Experience a wide-range of data analytics tools include Excel, SQL databases, R, and visualization.
1.  Develop a computational thinking approach to problem solving and use programs and scripting to solve data tasks.
1. Apply techniques to representative problems from the real word.


### Toolkit
Our toolkit refers to the tools, software, and techniques that you can use today to solve your problems.
Some of the things you will be adding to your toolkit include:
* Excel and Excel VBA
* SQL/databases
* command line
* Python and Python libraries for data analysis/visualization,
* R and R libraries for data analysis/visualization

* statistical analysis
* visualizing information


### My Course Goals
1. Provide the information in a simple, concise, and effective way for learning.
1. Strive for ***all*** students to understand the material and pass the course.
3. Be available for questions during class time, office hours, and at other times as needed.
4. Provide an introduction to data analytics tools and techniques so that students are able to apply data analysis to their own data sets.
5. Encourage students to continue with other data analytics/statistics/computer science courses.


### Course Format
- Each lecture will be posted on [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/).
- I encourage you to print them out/follow along with them on your computer.
- If possible, it will be beneficial that you download the necessary programs prior to lecture so that you can follow along with examples on your laptop.


### Email
I check email twice a day, once in the morning and once in the late afternoon. Emails will be answered in order of importance and
when they were received. In order to ensure a reasonably prompt response all Emails should use the following format:
- Subject line must begin with the course subject, eg. DATA 301 (or COSC 301 or DATA 501)
- The first line of the email you will state your name, student number and the course code as stated in the subject line.
Before e-mailing me, I encourage you to ask questions on Canvas’ Discussion Board.


### Labs
- Labs are held weekly starting next week.
- Please check your registration to determine your lab section and time.
- TAs will be in the lab each week to help with labs assignments and to provide help with general course material questions.
- While labs are not mandatory, you are highly encouraged to attend.
- You must be enrolled in a lab and you must only attend the lab you are enrolled in.
- While you will have access to University computers in the lab (all of the needed software should already be installed) feel free to bring in your laptops instead.


### Assignments
- Lab assignments are worth 30% (if enrolled in Data 301/Cosc 301) of your overall grade.
- Lab assignments may take more than the schedules lab time.
- Late assignments will have 10% deducted for each day (which includes weekends) beyond the due date. Assignments that are more than 5 days overdue will not be accepted.
- An assignment may be handed in any time before the due date.
- Assignments are critical to learning the material and are designed to prepare you for the exams and build up your skills!
- Please attend lab to go over any errors you made with your TA. Assignment solutions will not be posted.
- Lab assignments are done individually or in groups of two depending on the assignment.
- You are not bound to your partner and may choose to go solo on some or all of the subsequent assignments.
- Your partner need not be in the same lab section as you.
- If you are working with a partner, please decide on who will submit the documents to Canvas (only one person should upload these files).
- *Regardless* if you were the partner who uploaded the completed assignment, please include the name and student number of your partner in the **Assignment Comments**

### Academic Dishonesty
Cheating in all its forms is strictly prohibited and will be taken very seriously by the instructor.

> **Assignments** \
You are expect to submit original work done by you and acknowledge
all sources of information or ideas while attributing them to
others as required.

> **Exams** \
All exams are closed book, so no course materials should be
present.

### Academic Misconduct
Students are responsible for informing themselves of the guidelines of acceptable and unacceptable conduct for graded assignments
established by their instructors for specific courses, and of the examples of academic misconduct set out 
[here](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959). Some main concerns include:
- Plagiarism, which is intellectual theft, occurs when an individual submits or presents the oral or written work of
another person as his or her own.
- Submitting the same, or substantially the same, essay, presentation, or assignment more than once (whether the
earlier submission was at this or another institution) unless prior approval has been obtained from the instructor(s) to
whom the assignment is to be submitted.


### Disciplinary Measures
Academic misconduct that is subject to [disciplinary measures](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,960).

Academic misconduct often results in a one-year suspension from the University and a notation of academic discipline on the
student’s record. However, disciplinary measures which may be imposed, singly or in combination, for academic misconduct
include, but are not limited to, the following:
- a failing grade or mark of zero on the assignment or in the course in which the academic misconduct occurred

Note that all incidents of suspected academic misconduct must be reported to the Dean’s Office.


### Academic Dishonesty
> **Don’t cheat!** \
Do not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.

- Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious
consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline.
- Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences. If you have any questions about how
academic integrity applies to this course, please consult with your professor.


### How to Pass This Course
The most important things to do to pass this course:

**Attend class and labs** 
- Follow along and annotate the lecture notes in class.
- Participate in class exercises and questions.
- Labs are for marks and are practice to learn the material for the exams.

To get an “A" in this course do all the above plus:
- Practice on your own. Practice makes perfect.
- Do more questions than in the labs. Try the techniques on your own data sets.


### Disclaimer
There is a wide variety in previous experience.
- Some material you may already know. Help others!!
- Build up your computer experience in labs and outside of class.
- Third-year standing means that you know how to “figure things out.”

The course will be very straightforward: Do the work and practice the techniques to do well.


### Systems and Tools
All required software is available on the lab computers in SCI 234.If you have your own personal laptop, it is advised that you download
the required software prior to class so that you can follow along with examples in lecture.
- Our first unit uses Excel. A student download of Microsoft office is available [here](https://it.ubc.ca/software-downloads)

Canvas will be used for accessing lectures, submitting assignments, posting marks, discussions, and more,. . .
- Support for students is available [here](https://canvas.ok.ubc.ca/2019/07/03/students/)


### The In-Class Quizzes
- To encourage attendance and effort, 5% of your overall grade is allocated to answering in-class clicker questions.
- These questions are answered electronically using a clicker.
- The clicker can be purchased at the bookstore.
- Please refer to the **ClickerOrientation** file uploaded to the **Supplementary Material** Canvas on how to use them.

### Clickers
- The clicker is personalized to you with your student number.
- At different times during all the lectures, questions reviewing material will be asked. Responses are given using clickers.
- You must answer 80% of the questions correctly to get the full 5%.
- There are some (not-for-grading) example clicker questions at the end of the lecture (I will take them up next class to ensure
everyone has a chance to obtain a clicker first)

### Don’t forget to register your clickers on Canvas

### Types of Data Analysis
**Descriptive**: what are the features of the data? 

**Exploratory**: what new relationships/connections exist in the data?
> Correlation does not imply causation 

**Inferential**: use data samples to predict about larger population
> Statistical models: estimate value and uncertainty 

**Predictive**: use data to predict values for other objects 

**Causal**: what variables change values of other variables?
> Randomized studies: if give a drug/treatment, does it have a positive effect?
