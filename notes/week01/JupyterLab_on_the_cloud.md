While this is an option that is less demanding in terms of installations, doing your assignment there might not always be the most convenient. As you will advance in the course, you might find yourself frustated to have to wait when running your code.

## JupyterLab on your browser
For the part of the course that we move forward to learn Python( yay!), we will use the Jupyter notebook. For those of you that might have difficulty installing it on your local machine, there is an online server at UBC at this [address](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/). All you need is your UBC credentials to log in. Please note that its a remote server and it may not be as fast as the local one.
