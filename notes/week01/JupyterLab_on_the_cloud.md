While this is an option that is less demanding in terms of installations, doing your assignment there might not always be the most convenient. As you will advance in the course, you might find yourself frustated to have to wait when running your code.

## JupyterLab on your browser
For the part of the course where we move forward to learn Python, we will use the Jupyter notebook. For those of you that might have difficulty installing it on your local machine, there is an online server at UBC at this [address](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/). All you need is your UBC credentials to log in. 

Please note that its a remote server and it may not be as fast as the local one.

Here is a visual guide to using the remote server. Once you visit the website mentioned above and log in, you should see the following window. Select the Python 3 kernel.

It will direct you to a newly open tab and where you can start!

It's very straight forward! But remember, the help to install all the software is at the beginning of the term. Don't expect your TAs to help you with installation too far down the road in the course term.
