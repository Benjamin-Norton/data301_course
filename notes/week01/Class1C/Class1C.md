# Class 1C: GitHub and Accepting Labs


## Announcements

- Course (and Test) Schedule is now released
- Still considering what to do with Bonus Tests (stay tuned!)
- Labs will begin next week!
- Please use Ed Discussion to ask questions about any tech support issues you face! 
    - Thank you to to those that are asking and helping others!

## Logistics

During class we will go through some logistics, and then go through some terminology.

## Accept your first lab

The first thing you will generally need to do when a lab is released is to "accept it".
This means that you'll get a "copy" of the lab instructions and the folder where you are meant to do work.

- You will find the link to accept the lab on Canvas, under "Course Content ▶ GitHub Classroom Links".

Just click on the "Accept Lab" link, and it will take you to the page on GitHub.com where you will complete your lab.

```{important}
For some labs clicking the link will take you to an intermediate page where you'll be asked to wait till your "repository" is being created. Just be patient for a few seconds, and once it's done you should reload and the repository will be there for you. This whole process shouldn't take longer than 30 seconds.
```
- You can get your "Clone URL" from GitHub:

## Reminder: Learning Log 1

Learning Log 1 will be available to you after the last class of the week is over.

```{important}
That's it, see you next week! Remember to continue working on the "Setup" of your machines and visit the labs next week to get extra help!
