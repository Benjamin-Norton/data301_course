<label><input type="checkbox" id="week01_task2" class="box"> Attend the first **[lab](./lab1/README.md)** this week</input></label>

```{tip}
The labs will be semi-structured help sessions.
The TA will usually explain the key components of the lab for the first 15 minutes.
We will then take attendance mostly for tracking purposes, but attendance is not mandatory and you will not lose marks for not attending the lab.
You are welcome to attend additional labs or Student Hours in the course if you need extra help.
