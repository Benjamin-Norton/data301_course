<label><input type="checkbox" id="week01_task1" class="box"> Attend the lecture on Monday </input></label>

This week we will be doing course introductions, I will be showing you how to navigate the course website, and how the course is set up. In terms of content, there won't much real content, just dealing with course administrative stuff.

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week01_task2" class="box"> Attend the **[lab](./lab.md)** this week</input></label>

```{tip}
The lab is for installing and setting up all the software you need for the course.
The TA are there to help you install the programs for this course. I strongly encourage you to use them as resources. 
This lab is marked so the TA can ensure you have all you need for this class. 
TAs are also available at different office hours during the week if you did not finish the installation or are having difficulties with installation beyond the 2 hours lab.

## List of things to finish this week

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week01_task3" class="box"> Watch the **[introductory videos](./videos.md)**</input></label>

```{tip}
Some of you might already know this content, but for the others, it gives you some background as to what is data, how it is represented on a computer, and why command line might be useful in this course. Take the time to quickly review the slides before watching the videos if you need a refresher or never learned this.
