<label><input type="checkbox" id="week01_task2" class="box"> Attend the [lab](./lab.md) </input></label>

```{tip}
The lab is for installing and setting up all the software you need for the course.
The TA are there to help you install the programs for this course. I strongly encourage you to use them as resources. 
This lab is marked so the TA can ensure you have all you need for this class. 
TAs are also available at different office hours during the week if you did not finish the installation or are having difficulties with installation beyond the 2 hours lab.
