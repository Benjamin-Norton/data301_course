Week 1
=======================

This week we will be doing course introductions, I will be showing you how to navigate the course website, and how the course is set up. 
In terms of content, there won't much real content, just dealing with course administrative stuff.

```{tip}
You are highly encouraged (but not required) to attend labs this week ([Lab 0](../week02/). It will allow you to meet your TAs.

This week you can get help installing the programs for this course. I strongly encourage you to do so. The lab is OPTIONAL and if you are able to get all the install instructions completed, there is no need for you to attend the lab this week and there is nothing to turn in at the end.
