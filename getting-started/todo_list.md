Things to do at the start of the course
=======================

There are several things you'll need to do at the start of the course to get set up with all the technology, accounts, and services we'll be using.
I've split these tasks up into several chunks so it's a bit more manageable. 
In the first chunk (Before the first class) are the same things that you received through a Canvas Announcement.

```{dropdown} <h3>During the first class</h3>

<label><input type="checkbox" id="todo1-1" class="box"> **1. [Complete the Ed Discussion Survey](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bjBcTik01NqJ9A2?course=data301&term=2022_WT2)** </input></label> 

You will be invited to Ed Discussion based on the email you enter here! I will invite folks a couple of times a day.

<label><input type="checkbox" id="todo1-1" class="box"> **2. [Complete the anonymous pre-course survey](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7Oi7FwTWO2N5gMK?course=data301&term=2022_WT2)** </input></label> 

There is a good reason for this survey: I want to understand your current learning environments. Since we are all moving online forcibly, many of us may have challenges with available technology/equipment, or access to wireless internet (or power). The more I understand your circumstances (anonymously), the more I hope to do to accommodate everyone in the class. 

Again, this is optional but please fill it out!!

<label><input type="checkbox" id="todo1-2" class="box"> **2. Have a look at the Syllabus.** </input></label> 

It is now live on Canvas under the "Course Content" sidebar item. 

<label><input type="checkbox" id="todo1-3" class="box"> **3. Login to the official course discussion dashboard (Ed discussion).** </input></label> 

Within the Canvas course, [click the "Ed discussion" menu item](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/64282/external_tools/19893?display=borderless) on the left menubar - you will be asked to create an account.

```{dropdown} <h3>In the first week</h3>
    :class-container: sd-shadow-lg
    :color: primary
    :open:

<label><input type="checkbox" id="todo2-1" class="box"> **1. Attend the first class on Monday.** </input></label> 

<label><input type="checkbox" id="todo2-2" class="box"> **2. [Complete Lab 1](../notes/week01/lab.md)** </input></label>.

There is an assigned lab the first week to install all the software necessary for the course so that you are ready with everything working next week. Starting in Week 2, all the TAs will be available during the lab time to support you through the process of installing the software on your home machine.

This [lab](../notes/week01/lab.md) is based on the material developed by my colleagues in the MDS program, which uses many of the same tools we will be using throughout the course.
