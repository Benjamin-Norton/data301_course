## Spreadsheets: Microsoft Excel Part 1 of 3

### Why Spreadsheets and Microsoft Excel?
Spreadsheets are the most common, general-purpose software for data analysis and reporting.

Microsoft Excel is the most popular spreadsheet program with hundreds of millions of installations.
- The spreadsheet concepts translate to other products. 

Excel and spreadsheets are not always the best tool for data analysis, but they are great for quick analysis, reporting, and
sharing.

Follow along with the examples by downloading the **03ExcelPartI.xlsx** and **DemoPartI.xlsx** file from CANVAS.

### Spreadsheet Overview
A spreadsheet organizes information into a two-dimensional array of cells (a table).

A cell has two components:
- an address - specified given a column letter and row number
- a location - that can store a number, text, or formula

The power of a spreadsheet is that we can write simple formulas (commands) to perform calculations and immediately see the results of those calculations.

Spreadsheets are very common in business and reporting applications.

### Excel Ribon
**ribbon** The Excel ribbon is the strip of icons above the worksheet area. It replaces the menus and toolbars found in Excel 2003 and earlier.  
**ribbon tab** contains multiple commands logically sub-divided into groups

### Workbook vs. worksheets
**workbook** A workbook is the name given to an Excel file and contains one or more worksheets.  
**worksheet** A worksheet (or sheet/spreadsheet) is a single page in a file created with an electronic spreadsheet program.  
For example 03ExcelPartI.xlsx is a *workbook* that contains two *worksheets*. The name of these worksheets are QuarterSales and AnnualSales.

###Adding and renaming worksheets
To add a new worksheet we simply the plus sign located to the right of the worksheets.  
<img src="/source%20material/lectures/03Excel/img/rename.png" alt="rename" width="700" >  
By default, the worksheets are named Sheet1, Sheet2, Sheet3, and so on, but you can change these names by double clicking on the tab and typing an alternate name.  

- To Move a sheet, drag the sheet tab to the location that you want along the row of sheet tabs.
- To Copy a sheet
    1. Hold down Ctrl /Option (Windows/Mac).
    2. Drag the sheet tab to the location that you want the copied sheet to appear along the row of sheet tabs.
**Important** Release the mouse button before you release Option /Ctrl .
- To move/copy your worksheet to another workbook, you can right click the corresponding worksheet tab and select Move
- Copy. Select the desired workbook from the dropdown menu. Alternatively, you could follow the options outlined [here]

### Spreadsheet Addressing
A cell is identified by a column letter and row number.
<img src="/source%20material/lectures/03Excel/img/ExcelSheet.png" alt="ExcelSheet" width="700" >  
Notice how the *active cell* (the cell highlighted by the green rectangle in the spreadsheet) also displays its cell identifier in name
box located to the left of the formula bar.

- The *rows* in a spreadsheet are *numbered* starting from 1.
- The *columns* are represented by *letters*.
    - **A** is column 1, **B** is column 2, . . . , **Z** is column 26, **AA** is column 27, . . .
- A cell is identified by putting the column letter first then the row number.
    - e.g. **B3** is the 2nd column and the 3rd row.
Question: What column number is **AD**? How about **BAD**?

### Spreadsheet Data Entry
An entry is added to a cell by clicking on it and typing in the data.
- The spreadsheet attempts to detect the data type and format it accordingly. It is also possible to manually *format* the data

### Date and Type Formats
- Excel stores dates and time as a date serial number.
- The earliest date permitted by Excel is January 1, 1900 (which has a date serial number equal to 1).
- [DATEVALUE()](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/datevalue-function-df8b07d4-7761-4a93-bc33-b7471bbff252?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us)
function converts text to a date serial number which we can then format to display the day however we want
- Alternatively we could use the [DATE(year, month, day)](https://exceljet.net/excel-functions/excel-date-function) function which takes the arguments:  
**year** - Number for year.  
**month** - Number for month.  
**day** - Number for day.  
- It is important to note that Excel dates require a year, month, and day.
- That is, if you are missing a year, for example, Excel wonâ€™t be able to format that cell as a date unless we provide a year.
- One trick is to give your data an arbitrary year that you hide when you format your cells.
- For example, we could replace January with January 1, 2019 and format the cell to only display the month.

|Cell Format| Cell display|  |
|----| ---- | ----- |
|General| January |(treated as text)|
|Date |2019-01-01 |(treated as serial number 43466)|
|Custom |January |(treated as serial number 43466)|

- Formatting data helps users read and understand data and is especially important for numbers and dates.
- To change the format of a serial date, click the down arrow in the format drop down menu and select **More Number Formats**; this will open up the Format Cells pop-up box
<img src="/source%20material/lectures/03Excel/img/DateType.png" alt="DateType" width="400" >  

- You can use either built-in or custom formats or [custom formatting]
(https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2015/03/11/change-date-format-excel/#custom-date-format) (see a summary of these on the next slide)
- For example, applying the custom format of dd/mmm-yy on the date January 1, 2005 would display 01/Jan-05.
- You can also accomplish this type of formatting using the [TEXT()](https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2015/04/08/convert-date-text-excel/) 
function. These cells, however, will be treated as text, not dates.

### Custom Date Options
Here are some examples of custom formatting options. [Source: ablebits.com]

**Example (January 1, 2005)**  
|**Code**| Description| Result|
|-----|------------|------|
|m| Month number without a leading zero |1|
|mm |Month number with a leading zero |01|
|mmm |Month name, short form |Jan|
|mmmm |Month name, full form |January|
|mmmmm |Month as the first letter |J <sup>1</sup>|
|d |Day number without a leading zero |1|
|dd |Day number with a leading zero |01|
|ddd |Day of the week, short form |Mon|
|dddd |Day of the week, full form |Monday|
|yy |Year (last 2 digits) |05|
|yyyy |Year (4 digits) |2005|  

<sup>1</sup>(stands for January, June and July)  

### Currency vs Accounting
It is worth mentioning the difference between *Currency* and *Accounting* as they are very similar.
- Currency places the dollar sign to the immediate left of the number while Accounting places the dollar sign on the left edge of the cell.
- Currency displaces zeros as $0.00 while Accounting denotes zeros with dashes
- The Accounting format displays negative numbers in parentheses.

### Spreadsheet Formatting (Windows)
A text editor shortcut will allow you to format cells in bold, italics, underline, fonts, colours, justify, etc.
