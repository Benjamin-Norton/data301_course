<h1>DATA 301 - Introduction to Data Analytics
<br/>Lab 1: Excel - Analyzing and Reporting Data</h1>

<hr>

<p>In this lab, we will use Microsoft Excel to manipulate, transform, and analyze data.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Load CSV data into Excel and convert into a spreadsheet for processing.</li>
<li>Perform simple data cleaning (missing, incorrect) values, data type conversion, and cell formatting.</li>
<li>Understand and use Excel cell addressing including absolute addresses.</li>
<li>Create formulas including string and date functions, aggregate functions, and formulas with decisions.</li>
<li>Perform sorting and filtering to transform data for analysis.</li>
<li>Produce charts to visualize data and communicate results including using trendlines and sparklines.  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Analysis Problem and Goals</h3>

<p>This scenario involves analyzing data collected by sensors and applies to a variety of real-world applications including environmental monitoring (temperature, precipitation, wind, etc.), industrial and production sensors, and even monitoring of people using mobile devices and GPS. There are multiple monitoring <em>sites</em>.  Each site has one or more <em>sensors</em> that take a reading in a given interval.  Typically, <em>readings</em> are either an integer or floating-point value.  In this lab, each reading will consist of:

<ul>
<li><strong>timestamp</strong> - when the reading occurred</li>
<li><strong>siteid</strong> - an integer identifying a site uniquely</li>
<li><strong>sensorid</strong> - an integer identifying a sensor at a particular site uniquely</li>
<li><strong>value</strong> - an integer reading between 0 and 100, although data may be missing or incorrect</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Sensor readings are done every 15 minutes but may be missed (no data) or contain incorrect values out of range (less than 0 and above 100) or values that indicate error conditions (not at a number at all).
</p>

<p><a href="data.csv">Click here to download the data set</a> that consists of 4 sites each with 3 sensors that take readings every 15 minutes for 2 days.</p>


<h4>Goals</h4>

<p>The analysis goals are:

<ul>
<li><strong>Loading</strong> - load the input CSV file into Excel and convert into an Excel spreadsheet file.</li>
<li><strong>Cleaning</strong> - take the raw data and remove missing/incomplete values and convert the time currently in string form to an Excel datetime.</li>
<li><strong>Summary</strong> - calculate summary statistics for the data set including number of readings, maximum/minimum values, and readings for particular sensors.</li>
<li><strong>Transformation</strong> - transform the data set so that it is easier to analyze by creating a table where each row has a timestamp and readings in each column for every sensor at the site at that time.</li>
<li><strong>Visualization</strong> - create a chart that shows the sensor readings by time with trendlines.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong> - will determine if there are any trends for the three sensors at site 1.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Marking and Evaluation (15 marks)</h3>

<p>Marks are awarded by <em>precisely</em> following these requirements:

<ul>
<li><strong>Loading (1 mark) - </strong>submit an Excel file called <strong>lab1_(yourstudentnum).xlsx</strong> (e.g. <strong>lab1_11111111.xlsx</strong>) where the first sheet is called <em>rawdata</em> and contains the loaded data set with no changes.</li>

<li><strong>Cleaning and Formatting (5 marks) - </strong>create a second sheet called <em>data</em> that contains the data set after all incorrect and out-of-range values have been removed.
	<ul>
		<li>Any data that is not a number, is less than 0, or above 100 should be replaced by an <strong>empty string ("")</strong> (1 mark). Hint: May need to use <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/IF-function-69aed7c9-4e8a-4755-a9bc-aa8bbff73be2">IF</a> function.</li>
		<li>Header fields must be in bold font (0.5 marks).</li>
		<li>Timestamp field must be formatted as a date field in this format yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss (2 marks). Hint: May need to use <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/DATEVALUE-function-df8b07d4-7761-4a93-bc33-b7471bbff252">DATEVALUE</a> function and function like <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/MID-MIDB-functions-d5f9e25c-d7d6-472e-b568-4ecb12433028">MID</a> to convert date.  <a href="http://chandoo.org/wp/2010/03/23/text-to-date-convertion/">More info</a>.  Note that both the DATE and TIME need to be converted and added together to get a DATETIME.</li>
		<li>Data must be sorted by siteid (ascending), sensorid (ascending), then timestamp (ascending) (0.5 marks).</li>
		<li>Add a column called global_sensor_id that is generated by siteid&"_"&sensorid (1 mark).</li>
	</ul>
<li><strong>Summary (3 marks) </strong>- create a third sheet called <em>summary</em> that contains the following items:
	<ul>
	<li>Count of readings in B3, maximum reading value in B4, minimum reading value in B5, average reading in B6 (1 mark).</li>
	<li>Maximum reading by any sensor at site 2 in B8 (1 mark). Hint: Ctrl+Shift+Enter will be useful.  See: <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/674566/when-to-use-ctrlshiftenter-and-when-to-use-enter-in-excel">Array Output using Ctrl+Shift+Enter</a></li>
	<li>Number of readings for sensor 2 at site 1 in B10 (1 mark). Note: Include <strong>all</strong> readings including readings that were out of range/errors/blank.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transformation (3 marks) - </strong>create a fourth sheet called <em>transform</em> that contains a table where each row is a time and each column contains values for the sensor.
	<ul>
		<li>Creating data table (1 mark).</li>
		<li>Replacing missing values with NA() (0.5 marks). <a href="http://www.criticaltosuccess.com/when-data-points-are-bad-or-missing-how-do-you-create-a-usable-and-decent-looking-excel-chart/">More info</a> and <a href="http://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/2487-excel-conditional-formatting-if-na.html#a1">Using ISNA() function</a></li>
		<li>Adding sparklines in last column for each row (0.5 marks).</li>
		<li>Add conditional formatting so that cells with #N/A are filled in red and cells with values >= 90 are filled in green (1 mark).</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Visualization (2 marks) - </strong>create a <strong>XY Scatter chart (with smooth lines and markers)</strong> on a sheet called <em>chart</em> that shows the readings by time for all three sensors at site 1. Add an appropriate trendline for sensor 2 at site 1.</li>

<li><strong>Analysis (1 marks) - </strong>in the <em>summary</em> sheet put in cell B12 if sensor 2 at site 1 has any data trend (none, exponential, linear, etc.).</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>When complete, submit your Excel file named <strong>lab1_(yourstudentnum).xlsx</strong> (e.g. <strong>lab1_11111111.xlsx</strong>) using Connect.</p>
