\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vector}
A \emph{vector} is an indexed list of data of any type.
\vfill
Create vectors using a colon or \texttt{seq()} (R's version of range)
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> 1:10
[1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> seq(5, 1, by = -0.5 )
[1] 5.0 4.5 4.0 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
Create an empty vector with \texttt{c()} or fill it by specifying elements.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> c()
NULL
> c(4, 3, 5, 'a', 'd')
[1] "4" "3" "5" "a" "d"
\end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vector}
Access elements in a vector using \texttt{[ ]}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myVector = c(4, 3, 5, 'a', 'd')
> myVector[i]  #Returns the ith element of myVector
> myVector[1]
[1] "4"
\end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{ Vectors}
We could also name vectors (similar to Python's dictionaries)
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> names(myVector) <- c("first", "second", "third",
"fourth","fifth")
> myVector["first"]
first 
  "4" 
\end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vectors in R}
\begin{question}
Which (if any) of the following statements are true?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Vectors in R are indexed from 0.  \onslide<+-> \pxmark
\item \texttt{1:10} creates a vector of ten numbers. \pcmark
\item A vector may have data value of different types. \pxmark
\item If \texttt{data <- 1:5} then \texttt{data[2] + data[3] = 3}. \pxmark
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Matrices}
A \emph{matrix} is a structure of rows and columns where each data value is the same data type.  All rows must have the same length.  All columns must have the same length.
\vfill
Create a matrix from the vector \texttt{x} using \texttt{matrix()}.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> matrix(x, nrow=5, ncol=3, byrow=False)
# Starts at [1,1] and fills the column first before going to
# next column.
# Need to only specify ncol or nrow.
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
Access elements using \texttt{[row, col]}.  Leaving one of them blank returns the whole row or column.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myMatrix[i, j]  #Returns ith row and jth column.
\end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Matrices and Vectors}
\vfill
Append a vector to a matrix as a row using \texttt{rbind()}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myMatrix = rbind(myMatrix, vec)
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
Append a vector to a matrix as a column using \texttt{cbind()}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myMatrix = cbind(myMatrix, vec)
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Matrices and Vectors}
We could also name the columns are rows of a matrix:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> mat1 <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3)
> colnames(mat1) <- c("col1", "col2", "col3", "col4")
> rownames(mat1) <- c("row1", "row2", "row3")
> mat1["row1",] # same as mat[1,]
col1 col2 col3 col4 
   1    4    7   10 
> mat1$col3 # won't work (can only use $ on data.frames)
Error in mat1$col3 : $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors
\end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Lists}
A \emph{list} is an ordered collection of objects of \emph{any} type.
\vfill
Create a list using \texttt{list()}.  Specify names of elements by using \texttt{name =} inside the brackets.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myList = list(x=1:4, y=c('a', 'b'))
#Creates a list with two elements x and y
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
Access elements using the double square brackets.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myList[[2]]   # Returns the 2nd item of list (y)
> myList[['x']] #Returns item with the name x.
> myList$x #Returns item with the name x (no quotes)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Lists and Matrices in R}
\begin{question}
Which (if any) of the following statements are true?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Data values in a list may be of different types. \onslide<+-> \pcmark 
\item In a matrix, the number of rows and columns must be the same. \pxmark
\item Given matrix \texttt{m, m[2]} would return an error. \pxmark 
\item Given matrix \texttt{m, m[,2]} would return all data in column 2. \pcmark
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\begin{question}
Create a list called \texttt{grades} and add the following elements
\begin{enumerate}
\item Name (first name and last name),
\item Student number,
\item Assignment grades (multiple entries), and
\item Midterm grade.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Frame}
\vfill
A \emph{data frame} is similar to a matrix but the columns can have different data types.  Note these data frames are quite common and have uniform length of rows and columns.
\vfill
To create a data frame by using \texttt{data.frame()}, specify names of variables within the brackets:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myDF = data.frame(x = c(1:3), y = (2:4))
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
To convert a matrix into a \texttt{data.frame} using \texttt{as.data.frame()}.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myDF = as.data.frame(myMatrix)
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Accessing Data in Data Frames}

Access elements using \texttt{[row, col]} or \verb|$variable_name|.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myDF[i, j]           #ith row and jth column
> myDF\$x               #returns the column labelled x
\end{Verbatim}

Add new columns called \texttt{vec} into the data frame use in \verb|$|.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myDF$new_col = vec   #Adds vec as new_col
\end{Verbatim}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Factors}
\emph{Factors} are used for qualitative groups/categories (i.e. male/female).  Use \verb|as.factor()| to turn a vector or \verb|data.frame| column into a factor.
\vfill
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
mFyFactor = as.factor(x)
myDF\$x = as.factor(myDF\$x)
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
Access elements using \verb|[ ]|:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
myFactor[i]    #Returns ith element
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
Can use \verb|class()| or \verb|str()| to gain information about the type and/or structure of your variable/data. \verb|str()|  gives me detail.
\vfill
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\begin{question}
Which (if any) of the following are true?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Matrices must have the same number of rows as columns. \onslide<+-> \pxmark
\item Vectors must contain only one data type. \pcmark
\item \st{A factor can contain only characters.} 
% \footnote{this isn't a very good question} 
\textit{While we can use numbers to represent the factors (eg. 0 = male, 1 = female) they will be treated as characters in R. }
\item A  \emph{data frame's} columns can be of varying length. \pxmark
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Subsets}
Subsetting is used to extract data with particular values.
\vfill
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=2em, xrightmargin=1.5em, frame=single, label=Syntax in R, framesep=0.5em]
subset(data, condition)
# if we want to check two conditions:
subset(data, condition1 & condition2)
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=2em, xrightmargin=1.5em, frame=single, label=Example in R, framesep=0.5em]
cars_bc = subset(cars, prov == 'BC')

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\begin{question}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a \emph{data frame} \verb|mydata| with the following column names/data:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \verb|id| -- numbers one to 5.
\item \verb|location| -- ``BC'', ``BC'', ``AB'', ``MB'', ``BC''.
\item \verb|value| -- 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.
\item Make location a factor.
\end{enumerate}
\item Add one more column to your data frame that is a factor
\begin{enumerate}
\item \verb|success| -- ``Y'', ``N'', `N'', `N'', ``Y''.
\end{enumerate}
\item Display only the data from BC and value $\geq 20$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
