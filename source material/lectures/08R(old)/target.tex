\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vector}
A \emph{vector} is an indexed list of data of any type.
\vfill
Create vectors using a colon or \texttt{seq()} (R's version of range)
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> 1:10
[1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> seq(5, 1, by = -0.5 )
[1] 5.0 4.5 4.0 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
Create an empty vector with \texttt{c()} or fill it by specifying elements.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> c()
NULL
> c(4, 3, 5, 'a', 'd')
[1] "4" "3" "5" "a" "d"
\end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vector}
Access elements in a vector using \texttt{[ ]}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myVector = c(4, 3, 5, 'a', 'd')
> myVector[i]  #Returns the ith element of myVector
> myVector[1]
[1] "4"
\end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vectors in R}
\begin{question}
Which (if any) of the following statements are true?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Vectors in R are indexed from 0.  \onslide<+-> \pxmark
\item \texttt{1:10} creates a vector of ten numbers. \pcmark
\item A vector may have data value of different types. \pcmark

\end{question}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Matrices}
A \emph{matrix} is a structure of rows and columns where each data value is the same data type.  All rows must have the same length.  All columns must have the same length.
\vfill
Create a matrix from the vector \texttt{x} using \texttt{matrix()}.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> matrix(x, nrow=5, ncol=3, byrow=False)
# Starts at [1,1] and fills the column first before going to
# next column.
# Need to only specify ncol or nrow.
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
Access elements using \texttt{[row, col]}.  Leaving one of them blank returns the whole row or column.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myMatrix[i, j]  #Returns ith row and jth column.
\end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Matrices and Vectors}
\vfill
Append a vector to a matrix as a row using \texttt{rbind()}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myMatrix = rbind(myMatrix, vec)
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
Append a vector to a matrix as a column using \texttt{cbind()}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myMatrix = cbind(myMatrix, vec)
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myList = list(x=1:4, y=c('a', 'b'))
#Creates a list with two elements x and y
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
Access elements using the double square brackets.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myList[[2]]   # Returns the 2nd item of list (y)
> myList[['x']] #Returns item with the name x.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Frame}
\vfill
A \emph{data frame} is similar to a matrix but the columns can have different data types.  Note these data frames are quite common and have uniform length of rows and columns.
\vfill
To create a data frame by using \texttt{data.frame()}, specify names of variables within the brackets:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myDF = data.frame(x = c(1:3), y = (2:4))
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
To convert a matrix into a \texttt{data.frame} using \texttt{as.data.frame()}.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myDF = as.data.frame(myMatrix)
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Accessing Data in Data Frames}

Access elements using \texttt{[row, col]} or \verb|$variable_name|.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myDF[i, j]           #ith row and jth column
> myDF\$x               #returns the column labelled x
\end{Verbatim}

Add new columns called \texttt{vec} into the data frame use in \verb|$|.
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
> myDF$new_col = vec   #Adds vec as new_col
\end{Verbatim}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Factors}
\emph{Factors} are used for qualitative groups/categories (i.e. male/female).  Use \verb|as.factor()| to turn a vector or \verb|data.frame| column into a factor.
\vfill
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
mFyFactor = as.factor(x)
myDF\$x = as.factor(myDF\$x)
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
Access elements using \verb|[ ]|:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
myFactor[i]    #Returns ith element
\end{Verbatim}
\vfill
Can use \verb|class()| or \verb|str()| to gain information about the type and/or structure of your variable/data. \verb|str()|  gives me detail.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Confidence Intervals}
Consider the following statement
\begin{quotation}
``62\% of US college students miss a class due to excessive drinking.  The result is accurate with 1.7 percentage points 19 times out of 20.''
\end{quotation}
\vfill
Unpacking this statement:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{62} is the estimated percentage.
\item \emph{1.7} is the margin of error.
\item \emph{19 times out of 20} is the stated confidence and $100\% \frac{19}{20} = 95\%$.
\end{enumerate}

We call this a \emph{95\% confidence interval}: $(60.3,\, 63.7)$

\item Declare hypotheses statement and null hypothesis.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A p-value of 0.05 ``signifies that if the null hypothesis is true, and all other assumptions made are valid, there is a 5\% chance of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one observed.''
\end{enumerate}
\item Data is used as evidence.  Perform a test in order to make a decision:  reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
\end{enumerate}
\vfill
Note: We cannot \emph{prove} that the null hypothesis is true or false. We can only show that there is evidence to suggest one conclusion or another.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Two Sample Paired Test}
A \emph{paired (dependent) two sample test} compares two dependent samples to see if there is a difference between the groups.
\begin{enumerate}
\item This test typically uses multiple measurements on one subject.
\item Also called a "repeated measures" test.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Affect of treatment on a patient (before and after)
\item Apply something to test subjects to see if there is an effect

\vfill
A linear model is an equation that relates a response variable ($y$) to some explanatory variables ($x$'s).  The general form of the model is:
$$y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \cdots + b_nx_n$$
\vfill
Not all of the data points can fall on this line so the full equation is
$$y_i = b_0 + b_1 x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} + \cdot + b_nx_{bi} + \varepsilon_i$$

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Conclusion}
\begin{enumerate}
\item R is a free and open source programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
\item R contains many useful features for data analysis including data structures such as vectors and data frames that make it easy to perform statistical analysis and visualization.
\item R is often used for hypothesis testing and understanding how to properly setup and interpret a test is an important skill.
