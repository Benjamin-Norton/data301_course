\begin{frame}{What is R?}
R is a free and open source programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
\begin{enumerate}
\item One of the most widely used programming languages for statistical analysis.
\item Popular in academia and companies like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook. 
\item There are currently over 8000 packages in R. 
\url{cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html}
\item R creates high quality graphs and visualizations.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Why learn R?}
R is built to handle and analyze data. 
\begin{example}
Filtering a dataset to be within a lower and upper bound and then calculating summary statistics.\\[2em]

\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=2em, xrightmargin=1.5em, frame=single, numbers=left, label=Python, framesep=0.5em]
for v in data:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Descriptions or groups
      \item Can be characters or numbers

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Numerical Summaries}
\vfill
A \emph{numerical summary} provides an overview of data to help understand it without examining all data values.
\vfill
A \emph{measure of centre} and a \emph{measure of spread} to describe quantitative data. There are no numerical summaries for qualitative data, only graphical summaries. 
\vfill
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Measures of Centre}
\begin{definition}[Mean]
The \emph{mean} is the average of data values (sum of values divided by count):
$$
\by = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}{n}
$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Median]
The \emph{median} is the value at which half of the data lies above that value and half lies below it.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Odd number of observations: $\ty$ is the $k$th value where $k = \frac{n+1}2$.
\item Even number of observations: $\ty$ is the mean of the $k$th and $(k+1)$ terms, where $k = \frac n 2$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\begin{example}
Let the data be given by $y = \{1,\, 3,\, 3,\, 7,\, 9 \}$.  The \emph{mean} is
$$\by = \frac{1 + 3 + 3 + 7 + 9}{5} = 4.6$$
and the \emph{median} is
$$\ty = 3$$
for which R provides \texttt{mean()} and \texttt{median()}:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
\emph{> mean(y)}
[1] 4.6
\emph{> median(y)}
[1] 3
\end{Verbatim}
\end{example}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Measures of Spread}
A measure of spread indicates how far apart the values are.
\begin{definition}[Variance]
\emph{Variance} is the sum of the squares of each data point's distance from the mean:
$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\by)^2}{n-1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 - n\by^2}{n-1}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Standard Deviation]
\emph{Standard Deviation} is the square root of the variance: $s = \sqrt{s^2}$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Range]
\emph{Range} is the maximum value minus minimum value: $\max(y) - \min(y)$.
\end{definition}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\begin{example}[Standard Deviation]
Let $y = (1, 3, ,3,7, 9)$ then the \emph{variance} is
$$s^2 = \frac{(1+9+9+49+81)-(5 \cdot 4.6^2)}{5-1} = 10.8$$
and therefore the \emph{standard deviation is}
$$s = 3.286$$
for which R provides \texttt{mean()} and \texttt{median()}:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}, xleftmargin=2em]
\emph{> var(y)}
[1] 10.8
\emph{> median(y)}
[1] 3.286335

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Quantiles and Quartiles}
The \emph{$q$th quantile} is the point where at least $q \cdot 100\%$ of the data values are at or 
below the value.

There are some special quantiles called \emph{quartiles} (quarters of the data).
\begin{enumerate}
\item[Q1] First quartile.  0.25 quantile.
\item[Q2] Second quartile.  0.5 quantile.  Median.
\item[Q3]  Third quartile.  0.75 quantile.
\end{enumerate}

The \emph{interquartile range} is the difference between Q3 and Q1.
$${\textsc{IQR}} = Q3 - Q1$$
It contains the contains the center $50\%$ of the data.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\begin{example}
Let the data $y = \{1,\,2,\,3,\,4,\,5,\,6 \}$ and median $\ty = \frac{3+4}{2} = 3.5$. 

Q1 and Q3 are then the \emph{medians} of the two subsets of data when divided at the median:
\begin{align*}
y_1 = \{1,\,2,\,3\}  && y_2 = \{4,\,5,\,6\} && Q1 = 2 && Q3 = 5
\end{align*}

The function \texttt{quantile()} is provided in R.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data structures}
\begin{itemize}
\item R has a wide variety of data structures including:
\begin{itemize}
\item scalars
\item vectors (numerical, character, logical)
\item matrices
\item data frames, and
\item lists.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vectors}
\begin{itemize}
\item A vector is the most basic data structure in \R and can be of two types:
\begin{itemize}
\item atomic vectors (containing all the same type of data)
\item lists (can contain a mixture of different types of data)
\end{itemize}
\item As we did in the examples above, you can create a vector using \texttt{c} (see {\tt ?c} for more details on this \textit{combine} function)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vectors}
Atomic Vectors can be vectors characters, logical, integers or numeric.
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=0.3in]
# example of a numeric vector:
y=c(2,3,0,3,1,0,0,1)
# example of a character vector:
letters<-c('A','B','C')
# example of a logical vector:
lvec <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
\end{Verbatim}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vectors}
Numeric vectors can be created a number of different ways. 
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=0.3in]
# Ceate a vector of size 10, where each element is a 2:
y=rep(2,10)
# This specifies a sequence of integers:
y=3:12
#This specifies a sequence of real numbers:
z=seq(from=1,to=2,by=0.1)
#This specifies a sequence of real numbers:
z=seq(from=2,to=1,by=-0.1)
\end{Verbatim}
\begin{alertblock}{The end number (specified by the {\tt to} argument) \textit{is} inclusive!}
%Notice that the end number \textit{is} included in the sequence of numbers generated by \R
\end{alertblock}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Indexing Vectors}
To index an element from a vector, use single square brackets
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=0.3in]
> z = c("apples","bananas","oranges", "pineapples")
> z[1]
[1] "apples"
> z[2:3]
[1] "bananas" "oranges"
> z[c(4,2)] # for selecting non-contiguous elements
[1] "pineapples" "bananas"   
> z[-1] # removes the first item
[1] "bananas"    "oranges"    "pineapples"
\end{Verbatim}
\begin{alertblock}{Notice that the index begins at 1}
Also notice the difference in the \verb|[-1]| notation.
\end{alertblock}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{}
We have the option of including names for our vector elements (similar to a Python dictionary)
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=0.3in]
z = c(123456, 25, 2019)
names(z) <- c("studentID","age","year")
z["studentID"] # same as z[1]
z[c("age, year")] # wont work like z[c(2,3)]
z[c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)] # will work 
z[-"year"] # wont work like z[-3]
\end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{}
To add a new element/delete/replace an element:
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=0.4in]
> z = c("first","second","third", "fourth")
> # adds a fith element and replaces the second
> z[5] = "fifth" # doesn't need to exist before we assign
> z[2] = "2nd"
> z
[1] "first"  "2nd"    "third"  "fourth" "fifth" 
> #removes the second element
> (z = z[-2])
[1] "first"  "third"  "fourth" "fifth" 
\end{Verbatim}


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{}
Notice what happens if we add a 10th element to z (without specifying elements 6--9):
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=0.4in]
> z[10] = "tenth"
> z
 [1] "first"  "third"  "fourth" "fifth"  NA      
 [6] NA       NA       NA       NA       "tenth" 
 \end{Verbatim}
We can also add new named elements
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=0.4in]
> z = c(123456, 25, 2019)
> names(z) <- c("studentID","age","year")
> # adds a forth element with the students major
> z["major"] = "COSC"
> z
studentID       age      year     major 
 "123456"      "25"    "2019"    "COSC" 
 \end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vector operations}
Notice that operations performed on vectors get computed on each element of the vector (similar to {\tt map} iin Python)
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=0.4in]
> x <- 1:10
> y <- 11:20
> x*2
 [1]  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20
> x+y
 [1] 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30
\end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Matrices}
\begin{itemize}
\item While we can view matrices as column vectors stacked side by side or row vectors stack one on top of another, matrices are really just a vector in \R.
\item The main difference between matrices and the vectors discussed in the previous slides is that a matrix has a \define{dimension} (like {\tt numpy arrays} in Python)
\item The dimenions can be found using the {\tt dim()} function. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Matrices}
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=0.4in]
> (m <- matrix(1:8, nrow = 2, ncol = 4))
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    3    5    7
[2,]    2    4    6    8
> dim(m) # gives the number or rows and columns
[1] 2 4
> class(m)
[1] "matrix"
\end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Matrices}
\begin{itemize}
\item By default, matrices are constructed columnwise.  
\item You can always change to row-wise by specifying {\tt byrow=TRUE}
\end{itemize}
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}

\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Named Matrices}
We may also choose to name our rows and columns
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlkwd{rownames}\hlstd{(m)} \hlkwb{=} \hlkwd{c}\hlstd{(}\hlstr{"row1"}\hlstd{,} \hlstr{"row2"}\hlstd{)}
\hlkwd{colnames}\hlstd{(m)} \hlkwb{=} \hlkwd{c}\hlstd{(}\hlstr{"col1"}\hlstd{,} \hlstr{"col2"}\hlstd{,} \hlstr{"col3"}\hlstd{)}
\hlstd{m}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
##      col1 col2 col3
## row1    1    2    3
## row2    4    5    6
\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Indexing}
\begin{itemize}
\item To index an element from a matrix, we can again use square brackets, but we need to specify TWO numbers {\tt[row, col]}.
\item  If we want to extract an entire row, we'll leave the {\tt col} field blank (indicating we want all colums).
\item  If we want to extract an entire column, we'll leave the {\tt row} field blank (indicating we want all rows).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Indexing}
The following extracts a column, row, and cell from matrix {\tt m},
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlcom{# extract the third column of m}
\hlstd{m[,}\hlnum{3}\hlstd{]}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
## row1 row2 
##    3    6
\end{verbatim}
\begin{alltt}
\hlcom{# extract the first row of m}
\hlstd{m[}\hlnum{1}\hlstd{,]}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
## col1 col2 col3 
##    1    2    3
\end{verbatim}
\begin{alltt}
\hlcom{# extract the element in the 1st row and 3rd column}
\hlstd{m[}\hlnum{1}\hlstd{,}\hlnum{3}\hlstd{]}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 3
\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{}
Alternatively we could call them by name
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlcom{# extract the third column of m}
\hlstd{m[,}\hlstr{"col3"}\hlstd{]} \hlcom{# same as m[,3]}

\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
\begin{alltt}
\hlcom{# extract the element in the 1st row and 3rd column}
\hlstd{m[}\hlstr{"row1"}\hlstd{,}\hlstr{"col3"}\hlstd{]} \hlcom{# same as m[1,3]}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 3
\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Indexing}
Note that we can also use one number (tricker this way)
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlstd{(m} \hlkwb{=} \hlkwd{matrix}\hlstd{(}\hlnum{11}\hlopt{:}\hlnum{4}\hlstd{,} \hlnum{2}\hlstd{,}\hlnum{4}\hlstd{))}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}

\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 4
\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Indexing}
Like the vectors discussed earlier, matices fall under the atomic vector category and therefore can only store data of one type:
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlstd{m} \hlkwb{=} \hlkwd{matrix}\hlstd{(}\hlkwd{c}\hlstd{(}\hlstr{"bananas"}\hlstd{,} \hlnum{2}\hlstd{,} \hlnum{TRUE}\hlstd{,} \hlnum{0}\hlstd{),}  \hlkwc{nrow}\hlstd{=}\hlnum{2}\hlstd{,} \hlkwc{ncol}\hlstd{=}\hlnum{2}\hlstd{)}
\hlcom{# notice how all coerce to characters:}
\hlstd{m}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
##      [,1]      [,2]  
## [1,] "bananas" "TRUE"
## [2,] "2"       "0"
\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}[fragile]{lists}
\begin{itemize}
\item
If we want our vector to contain objects of different data types we need to create a list.
\item We can think of lists as a special type of vector that can mix data types and  structures
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{}

\begin{knitrout}\scriptsize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}

\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{lists}
Unlike vectors, the member of a list are accessed using double square brackets:
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlstd{x[[}\hlnum{1}\hlstd{]]} \hlcom{# first member}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}

\begin{alltt}
\hlstd{x[[}\hlnum{2}\hlstd{]]} \hlcom{# second member, and so on ...}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "banana"
\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{lists}
\begin{itemize}
\item While I have specified each member to be a single word/number/logical, we could also have specified them to be vectors or matrices. 
\item To index the elements within the members of a list we use single square brackets (usually nested after double square brackets)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{lists}
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Named lists}
Alternatively we could have names for our list members
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}

\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
## [1] TRUE
\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{}
We could also name the list members after they have been assigned
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}

## [1] TRUE
\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{lists}
We can index members of lists using the integer index numbers OR their member names (in quotations) 
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}

\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}[fragile]{lists}
We can modify its content/add new content directly either using {\tt [[]]} with numbers or {\tt \$} with member names. 
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Frames}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data frames are perhaps the most used data structure used in statistics. 
\item Like list, they can store different data types.
\item Futhermore, they can contain  additional attributes such as column and row names. \item When combining vectors in a data frame  all must have the same size (i.e. length).  \item Missing observations will be recorded as \texttt{NA}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Frames}
Here is an example of how to create a data frame and add to it: 
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Frames}
Like matrices, we can create column and row names
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlkwd{colnames}\hlstd{(Lab)} \hlcom{# adopted from the variable names inputed}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
\begin{alltt}
\hlkwd{rownames}\hlstd{(Lab)} \hlcom{# default to increasing integers}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "1" "2" "3"
\end{verbatim}
\begin{alltt}
\hlcom{# we could also add row names if we choose}
\hlkwd{rownames}\hlstd{(Lab)} \hlkwb{=} \hlkwd{c}\hlstd{(}\hlstr{"Student1"}\hlstd{,} \hlstr{"Student2"}\hlstd{,} \hlstr{"Student3"}\hlstd{)}
\hlstd{Lab}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
##          Person Grade
## Student1   John    45
## Student2   Jill    92
## Student3   Jack    91
\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Frames}
Unlike matrices, we can extract a column of this data.frame we use the {\tt \$} notation:
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlstd{Lab}\hlopt{$}\hlstd{Person}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
## [1] John Jill Jack
## Levels: Jack Jill John
\end{verbatim}
\begin{alltt}
\hlstd{Lab}\hlopt{$}\hlstd{Grade}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 45 92 91
## Levels: 45 91 92
\end{verbatim}
\begin{alltt}
\hlcom{# N.B. This does not work for rows:}
\hlstd{Lab}\hlopt{$}\hlstd{Student1}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
## NULL
\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Aside}{Smart Autofill}
\begin{itemize}
\item In some situations, \R will try to autocomplete commands for us.  When you begin to type {\tt Lab\$} for instance, you will see the options for the column names appear.
\item You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate through the options.
\item Press \keystroke{ENTER} when you land on the option you want.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Frames}
Adding a column to the data frame is as easy as typing:
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlstd{Lab}\hlopt{$}\hlstd{Passed}\hlkwb{=}\hlkwd{c}\hlstd{(}\hlnum{FALSE}\hlstd{,}\hlnum{TRUE}\hlstd{,}\hlnum{TRUE}\hlstd{)}
\hlstd{Lab}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
##          Person Grade Passed
## Student1   John    45  FALSE
## Student2   Jill    92   TRUE
## Student3   Jack    91   TRUE
\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Attributes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each of these objects have so-called \emph{attributes}. %Think of attributes as their ‘identifier’, a name or number which aptly identifies them. 
\item Here are some examples of attributes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item names, dimension names
\item dimensions
\item class
\item length
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Attributes}
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlkwd{attributes}\hlstd{(Lab)} \hlcom{# data vector defined in previous example}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
## $names

## 
## $row.names
## [1] "Student1" "Student2" "Student3"
##

\end{verbatim}
\begin{alltt}
\hlkwd{attributes}\hlstd{(m)} \hlcom{# matrix defined previously}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Data Entry}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data entry can be either done by hand (impractical), or loaded from an existing file. 
\item  {\tt read.table} is a convenient way of reading data into \R and storing it to a data frame.
\item The data should be formated such that each rows contains information regarding one subject with data separated by white space/commas/tabs/.
\item The first line may (or may not) contain a {\tt header} with the names of the variables in each column.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Entry}
Let's take the data {\tt intake.txt} data available on CANVAS which looks like this:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c  }
``pre" &  ``post" \\
5260 &3910\\
5470 &4220\\
5640 &3885\\
6180 &5160\\
6390 &5645\\
6515 &4680\\
6805 &5265\\
7515& 5975\\
7515 &6790\\
8230& 6900\\
8770& 7335 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Entry}
To read the data in:
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlkwd{read.table}\hlstd{(}\hlstr{"intake.txt"}\hlstd{,} \hlkwc{header}\hlstd{=}\hlnum{TRUE}\hlstd{)}
\end{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
##     pre post
## 1  5260 3910
## 2  5470 4220
## 3  5640 3885
## 4  6180 5160
## 5  6390 5645
## 6  6515 4680
## 7  6805 5265
## 8  7515 5975
## 9  7515 6790
## 10 8230 6900
## 11 8770 7335
\end{verbatim}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Entry}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt header=TRUE} indicates that the first line of file contains the names of the variables (rather than data values). 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt header=TRUE} allows {\tt pre} and {\tt post} to be read in as column names.
\end{itemize}
\item ({\tt header=FALSE} by default)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Entry}
Since we didn't save it to a variable, it simple prints it to the screen.  This wont be very useful in practice, so save it to a variable with a name that makes sense.
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlstd{intake} \hlkwb{=} \hlkwd{read.table}\hlstd{(}\hlstr{"intake.txt"}\hlstd{,} \hlkwc{header}\hlstd{=}\hlnum{TRUE}\hlstd{)}
\end{alltt}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Aside}{Name Rules}
There are rules on the types of names we can give variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item No spaces
\item No special characters (apart from periods and underscores)
\item Can't begin with a number
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Entry}
If we instead want to import the {\tt data.csv} file avialble on CANVAS, we simply specify that our separator is a comma.
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlstd{data} \hlkwb{=} \hlkwd{read.table}\hlstd{(}\hlstr{"data.csv"}\hlstd{,} \hlkwc{sep}\hlstd{=}\hlstr{","}\hlstd{,} \hlkwc{header}\hlstd{=}\hlnum{TRUE}\hlstd{)}
\end{alltt}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
Alternatively, we could have used the {\tt read.csv()} function
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlstd{data} \hlkwb{=} \hlkwd{read.csv}\hlstd{(}\hlstr{"data.csv"}\hlstd{)} \hlcom{# header=TRUE by default in read.csv}
\end{alltt}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Entry}
If you want to specify a file that is outside of your working directory, simply specify the path name preceeding the filename. For example:
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlstd{data} \hlkwb{<-} \hlkwd{read.csv}\hlstd{(}\hlstr{"/Users/ivrbik/DATA101/data.csv"}\hlstd{,} \hlkwc{header}\hlstd{=T)}
\end{alltt}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}
%
%\begin{frame}[fragile]{Working Directory}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Since the data was stored in my local directory, I did not did to specify a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)}{path}.
%\item To check what your working directory is, type {\tt getwd()}
%\item To change your working directory, type \verb|setwd(<path to your folder>)| or 
% do the following on a PC or MAC:
%\begin{center}
%Session $\rightarrow$ Set Working Directory $\rightarrow$ Choose Directory...
%\end{center}
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data Exporting}
There is also a function that will allow you to write the contents of a data frame to a file.  For instance, we could save our simple {\tt Lab} data frame to a textfile called {\tt Lab.txt} or  {\tt Lab.csv} using the following:
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlkwd{write.table}\hlstd{(Lab,} \hlkwc{file}\hlstd{=}\hlstr{"Lab.txt"}\hlstd{)}
\hlkwd{write.csv}\hlstd{(Lab,} \hlkwc{file}\hlstd{=}\hlstr{"Lab.csv"}\hlstd{)}
\end{alltt}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
Like the {\tt read} functions, {\tt write} will, by default, save these files to your working direction. To specify otherwise use:
\begin{knitrout}\footnotesize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{kframe}
\begin{alltt}
\hlkwd{write.table}\hlstd{(Lab,} \hlkwc{file}\hlstd{=}\hlstr{"<path>/Lab.txt"}\hlstd{)}
\end{alltt}
\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
\end{frame}
