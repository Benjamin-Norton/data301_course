# Milestone 4 - Present your Dashboard!

In this milestone you will be presenting all your hard-work to your fellow students! 

There is no GH Classroom link to accept for this milestone or milestone 4.

## Due Date 

The due date for this milestone is **Friday December 4, 2020**.

## Overall Expectations

- You should be committing to git every time you work on this project.
- On average, all team members should be contributing to the project equally!
- git commit messages should be meaningful. These will be marked. It's OK if one or two are less meaningful, but most should be.
- Use GitHub issues to communicate and document major decisions 
- Your question, analysis and visualizations should make sense. It doesn't have to be complicated.
- You should use proper grammar and full sentences in your READMEs. Point form may occur, but should be less than 30% of your written documents.
- You must use proper English, spelling, and grammar.
- You should write concisely. 

## Task 1: Present your dashboard (100%)

Project presentations will be 5 minutes each (whether your project is solo or in a group).

Other requirements:

- TBD

In terms of format, you have two options:

1. Present your dashboard live during the last class of the term.

- Sign up for this [here (coming soon!)](). There are a limited number of spots, this will be a combination of by invitation and first-come first served! 

2. Record a video screencast of your dashboard

- Your video should be uploaded to a cloud sharing site (YouTube, Vimeo, Google Drive, Dropbox, Sync.com, etc...)

## Working collaboratively in GitHub

As we progress through the course, you will be learning more and more about GitHub and how to work collaboratively on code.
Since this is the first time many of you are using Git, I recommend that if you are working in a group, you avoid editing each others' files until you are more familiar with git.
Below are a few things you may find useful as you continue your git journey.

### Git Branches

Git branches were introduced in Milestone 2.

### Pull requests

Once you have created a branch and "completed" a feature, it's time to merge the feature back to the `main` (or `master`) branch.
Of course, as you learned in the tutorial you can do this yourself, but in general it's a good idea for another teammate to review your work before it is merged into master. 
This is where Pull Requests come in:

To create pull requests (even students working solo can do this), [you can follow Steps 4 and 5 from here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr), and then assign a reviewer (from your group) to look at your code.

### Git Issues, Milestones, Labels, and Assignees

From GitHub's documentation:

> **Issues** are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository.

> **Labels** are a great way to organize different types of issues. Issues can have as many labels as you want, and you can filter by one or many labels at once.

> **Milestones**, are groups of issues that correspond to a project, feature, or time period. People use them in many different ways in software development.

> Assignees are a great way to filter, categorize issues, and remember what you're responsible to do. Each issue can have an assignee — one person that’s responsible for moving the issue forward. Assignees are selected the same way milestones are, through the grey bar at the top of the issue.

You can change or add a milestone, an assignee, and labels by clicking their corresponding gears in the sidebar on the right.

### How to pull the most recent changes to your computer

If you edit your code on the GitHub web interface, or if another user commits to your repository, to update the repository with the most recent changes, you should **always start a working session by running this command** in your git repository (using either Terminal or GitBash): 

> `git pull`

This will make sure your local computer is updated with any changes.
Commit and push your changes often while you work to stay in sync.
