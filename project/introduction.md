# DATA 301 Project

## Introduction

One of the best parts of Data Science is that after learning just a little bit of background language, your world will open up drastically and you now have the power to explore whole datasets!
It's a whole new world...

You can find a dataset about something that you're passionate about like climate change, music, financial information, vacation rentals, flight prices, stock prices, population data, vaccine efficacy, etc...
Then practice using the techniques from this course on this dataset, and start exploring interesting questions, as well as more advanced data science techniques.
Research shows that intrinsic motivation (defined below) have significant effects in students being more genuinely engaged in the learning activities, more dedicated to the task achieving deeper learning, and more persistent in the face of learning challenges {cite}`Vansteenkiste2004`.

```{tip}
Definition: "Intrinsic motivation refers to peopleâ€™s spontaneous tendencies to be curious and interested, to seek out challenges and to exercise and develop their skills and knowledge, even in the absence of operationally separable rewards".{cite}`Domenico2017`.

## Logistics

### Group Size

The project can be done as a group of 2, as a group of 3, or individually.
I encourage you to work in a group, and I expect that you will learn a lot more working collaboratively, including how to use `Git` and `GitHub` in a team setting.
This will be an excellent skill to put on your CV, and it will also be much closer to what happens in real life.
In non-pandemic times, this is a group project and students don't have the option to do it individually.
In pandemic times, I can understand that time zones and your personal situations might make group work difficult, so you may choose the individual project option.

### Join a Group

All students (even those doing the project individually) must join a group so you can be assigned a group number. 
Group numbers are sequential from 1 onwards.
Please try to join groups sequentially - i.e. don't join group 55 when the next available group is 4.
Please do not join a group without talking to the other member(s) first and discussing a plan (see below).

### How to form a team

There is a little bit of additional work needed to form a team, so we can make sure that all team members are on the same page, and teamwork can happen harmoniously.



## Task: Fill in the Survey


As much as possible, I would like to create teams that can work well together. To do so, I will ask you a few questions so that I can do better than just a random assignment to a team.

Please [fill in the following survey](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_efYTZXeg9ajTYDr) by **Friday January 22, 2021** (end of day). The survey is very short and should take only a couple of minutes (maximum 5 minutes). If you do not complete the survey, I will be assign you randomly to a group.
