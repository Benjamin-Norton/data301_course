# Project Introduction

This project will replace the final exam in your class. The project can be done alone or as a group of 3. I do encourage you to work as a group, as this is much closer to what happens in real life (with its good and not so good sides). However, I realize that some of you are in part of the world where finding partners with the same time zones (or close) can be difficult.

In order to be prepared for the project, I need to create the team by **Friday February 22, 2021**.

## Task: Fill in the Survey

As much as possible, I would like to create teams that can work well together. To do so, I will ask you a few questions so that I can do better than just a random assignment to a team.

Please [fill in the following survey](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_efYTZXeg9ajTYDr) by **Friday February 22, 2021** (end of day). The survey is very short and should take only a couple of minutes (maximum 5 minutes). If you do not complete the survey, I will be assign you randomly to a group.
